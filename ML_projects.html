  <h2>Machine Learning for skeletal human remains sex detemrination</h2></br>
  Sex determination of skeletal human remains is a common classification problem in
archaeology, anthropology or forensic science. In the present paper, a number of
different machine learning data analysis techniques have been tested for suitability for
this task. Humerus, femur, radius and tibia measurements from the Goldman
Osteological Dataset were used, and data from all the bone surface around and from
different areas were combined in order to examine the different techniques in the usual
different conservation conditions present in osteological remains. An accuracy of more
than 94% was reached using humerus, femur or tibia measurements, and more than
85% with radius ones. Even using epiphyseal measurements, more than 76% of
accuracy was reached in the worst scenario.Those results show how machine learning
techniques represents a revolutionary analytical approach in all science fields,
including Archaeology.

A preview of this project was presented in the conference "MACHINE LEARNING IN ARCHAEOLOGY" in Rome, in November 2019
